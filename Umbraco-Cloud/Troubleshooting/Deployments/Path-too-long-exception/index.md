# Path too long Exception

When you have Media files on your Umbraco Cloud project with a file-name longer than 80 characters, you will not be able to transfer and / or restore between your Cloud environments.

## How does it look?

The exception you will see on content transfer / restore will look something like this:

`System.IO.PathTooLongException: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.`

The full stacktrace:

```

This is a known issue with Microsoft servers, that limits the amounts of characters allowed in a path.

More info is comming shortly on how to fix this error!
